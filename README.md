# Beatrun | Community edition

This is Mistery1307's fork of Beatrun, it exists pretty much only for the purposes of making pull requests to JonnyBro's main fork. As such, I don't have an installer ready for you, but if you just wanna copy the "gamemode" folder, it'll likely work pretty okay as long as I didn't do something really stupid.
